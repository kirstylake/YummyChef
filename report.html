    <h3>
        Introduction
    </h3>
    <p>
        My website is a cooking club magazine called YummyChef, it intends to bring likeminded chefs together to cook,
        bake and learn
        together. It is a central place where recipes, events and other cooking-inspired activities can be found. It tells the story of people who are
        passionate about cooking and who want to better their skills in the company of other chefs. I chose to implement a ery sleek and easy to use structure that is 
        scalable and can have more recipes added at any time.
    </p>
    <h3>
        Inspiration
    </h3>
    <p>
        I was inspired by the <a href="https://www.foodandhome.co.za/">Food&Home</a> website. This website is a food and home magazine that intends to share new recipes 
        every week. Their website is full of information, and even has adverts for companies that sell food, however I preferred to
        have a more minimalistic and modern look for my website. It was a beginning point to inspire me in what I should be striving for.
        I also was inspired by <a href="https://www.epicurious.com/ ">Epicurious</a>. I loved how they have a search bar that allows users to effortlessly find the
        recipe that they are looking for. They also have big eye catching images that really grab the attention of the user, this inspired me to use
        large eye-catching images for my website too. They have a sleek layout which looks great in any web browser or mobile, I
        achieved a similar looking sleek layout using bootstrap and css.
        <a href="https://www.allrecipes.com/">All Recipes</a> was also an inspiration. They write a little bit about the recipes before showing how to make them,
        this inspired me to do something similar with my website and have a photography section aswell as little informative animations over my recipe images.
        I enjoyed the way their recipes were shown and tried to achieve a similar look using bootstrap cards. 
        I added my own flare to my website by adding events that would be hosted by YummyChef Inc.
    </p>
    <h3>
        Accessibility
    </h3>
    <p> All of the images have alternate descriptions so that people with visual disabilities can still have a description of what is being shown
        this is useful for any user that may use assistive technology to help them read the site. The colour scheme for the website is very contrasting and
        most of the text is on top of very plain backgrounds, this makes reading the website better for people with visual disabilities. </p>
    <p> The website uses big cards to display recipes, and big buttons to navigate the web page, people with motor skill disabilities will find it 
        easy to use these big buttons and will be able to navigate to recipes easily.
    </p>
    <p> The different sections of my webpage use appropriate tags to show a difference between heading and paragraphs. I
        use the h4, h3, h2, and h1 tags with care and thought. This will help any assistive technology to decipher why certain sections are placed 
        where they are and in turn will help the user to navigate through the site</p>
    <h3>
        Useability
    </h3>
    <p> The website is incredibly easy to use as all the main information is at the top navigation tags, that is; I have a clear
        navigation scheme which feels natural to the user, and
        there are even links that can take you directly to a portion of a page that you may be looking for (i.e the
        “about us" link </p>
    <p> I also conducted useability tests with my family and friends about a week before the project deadline to adjust
        the website to be more user friendly.
        I instructed them to find certain aspects of the page and depending on how much they struggled, I then
        rearranged my layout to accommodate them.</p>
    <p> I have optimized the performance of the page by using the two second rule, if anything took longer than two
        seconds to load I would look at ways to either make
        the image files smaller or look at what is causing the sluggishness (ie if the JS was written ineffectively).
    </p>
    <p> My website has also been designed to be responsive, I adapted the code to account for all the mobile devices
        that are given on chrome.
        This means that my site works smoothly regardless of the device it is displayed on. I used bootstrap mostly to
        accomplish this, and where bootstrap couldn’t provide me
        with the layout I desired, I then used CSS to override the bootstrap commands.</p>
    <h3>
        What I had to learn/find out
    </h3>
    <p> I was originally not that familiar with any tool to help with web design, in fact I really struggled to grasp
        the concept of html and css.
        So I did most of my research on bootstrap straight from the <a
            href="https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/getting-started/introduction/"> bootstrap 5 website</a>,
        (you will see this in the code, majority of my spacing is controlled by bootstrap). This made the
        coding process
        so much easier and I really enjoyed the grid system
        (I know some people are not a fan). I found myself being inspired by the capabilities of this framework.
        The responsiveness using bootstrap was also completely
        new to me and in many aspects the responsiveness was limited and wouldn’t display elements the way I wanted them
        to be shown, so I also had to learn to what extent
        css can override bootstrap commands by trial and error and using the console on Chrome. I eventually
        discovered that the “!important” command in css
        can override bootstrap commands.</p>
    <p> I had to learn about animations and how to apply them to elements only when the scrollbar comes close to them, I
        did this by watching some youtube tutorials
        (these are referenced where I used them in the code aswell). I also had to learn about how the different
        animations work for different browsers and how to implement
        this difference in my css code. I had to learn how to create hover effects over an image. Initially the idea was to create a hover effect that
        covered the entire photo, I tried a few different
        techniques that didn’t work, as my images were contained in bootstrap cards and the formatting was always going
        over the picture.
        I found a resource that explained how to get writing to only partially show over an image and I adapted this to
        work within cards, this is referenced in the code.</p>
    <p> I had issues trying to pass variables between pages because I didn’t know that the javascript files are
        reloaded everytime a user navigates to another page.
        This was such an interesting journey and definitely had me scratching my head as to why my parameters were not
        being passed, as I have never worked with a multiple
        web page project that implements Javascript. I found out by many google searches that the fix is to store the
        variable in “localStorage”. </p>

    <h3>What aspects worked well and why?</h3>
    <p>I am pleasantly surprised at how well my entire project turned out, I kept battling with little pieces until I
        looked at the project I had created and it was this
        complex beautiful design. I think the way I laid everything out is aesthetically pleasing, and this has been
        confirmed by family and friends that tested the useability
        of the site. </p>
    <p>One of my favourite features of the site is how the words on the top jumbotrons fade in, it gives the site this
        sleek polished look. I also love how I implemented
        the “single-recipes” page, this page dynamically creates itself depending on which recipe was selected in the
        previous page. It looks a bit simple to the user,
        but the javascript that made that happen took me a lot of time and careful thought. I decided to implement
        objects to hold the recipe information,
        this way if in future more recipes are to be added all the developer will have to do is just create an object
        for the recipe and when the user clicks on its card it
        will be dynamically created. This was fun for me to implement because I used my Intro To Programming 2 knowledge
        to modify the DOM. I must admit, although this
        course encouraged us to use a templating engine such as mustache, it just didn’t feel intuitive to me and the
        resources available for its javascript implementation
        were scarce, so I decided to stick with what I know which is vanilla Javascript. </p>

    <h3>What aspects could be improved and how might you do things differently next time? </h3>
    <p>I think I could use Javascript to dynamically create the recipe cards based on what objects are present
        in the Javascript file,
        this would make maintenance of the site so much easier and would allow the user to remove and add recipes at
        their leisure,
        this could also be organized according to the date they were added. </p>
    <p>I also could add functionaliy to the search bar at the top of the website, currently that search bar is just
        present as a place holder,
        but adding functionaliy to it would make the site a lot more user friendly and would help the users
        immediately find the recipe they are looking for. </p>
    <p>I also wanted to add categories to the recipes page such as “beef”, “vegetarian”, “chicken” etc, as to further
        filter the recipes so the user can find what they are
        looking for easily. </p>
    <p>I would probably want to use something like JQuery next time to modify the html, I think it would be quicker and
        probably easier to understand from an outside party. </p>
    <p>I could also make the links to social media at the footer actually work and link to real social media pages (this
        would only be possible if the website was being built
        for a real company)</p>

    <h3>What resources were used? </h3>
    <ul>
        <li>I learned most of my html coding from the <a
                href="https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/getting-started/introduction/">bootstrap 5 website</a></li>
        <li>I used youtube programming videos such as the <a
                href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eow125xV5-c&list=PLS5t95tNQJJK4kptptWjNGU0DnLjtSZoI&index=1">bootstrap
                tutorial</a></li>
        <li>I used the <a href="https://fontawesome.com/">awesome fonts</a> icon library</li>
        <li><a href="https://www.w3schools.com/">W3C schools</a> for a lot of the html and css resources</li>
        <li>I used <a href="https://www.google.co.za/">Google</a> with the extension <a
                href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/grepper/amaaokahonnfjjemodnpmeenfpnnbkco?hl=en">Grepper</a>
            to help me search for coding solutions quickly </li>
        <li>Most of my images were from <a href="https://www.pexels.com/">Pexels</a>(they are referenced as they are
            used in the code)</li>
        <li>I used the <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/">bootstrap library</a></li>
